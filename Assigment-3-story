â€œIt all started when our predictably heroic protagonist, Jeff Breakfast, woke up in a haunted thicket. It was the third time it had happened. Feeling abnormally relieved, Jeff Breakfast stroked a live hand grenade, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Duly ecstatic about the looming crises, he realized that his beloved iPhone was missing!  Immediately he called his fundamentalist, guilt-dispensing friend, Stephanie Toast. Jeff Breakfast had known Stephanie Toast for (plus or minus) 153 years, the majority of which were striking ones.  Stephanie Toast was unique. She was outgoing though sometimes a little... selfish. Jeff Breakfast called her anyway, for the situation was urgent.
